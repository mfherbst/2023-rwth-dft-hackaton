A good next density $\\rho_{n+1}$ therefore should be found by minimising an approximation for $R(\\rho_{n+1})$. Assuming the SCF was linear in the density (which it is not), a good idea is to find a linear combination of residuals\n",

Due to a number of instabilities in the modelled systems either the smallest eigenvalue can decrease or the largest eigenvalue can increase, thus giving a larker condition number $\\kappa$ and worse convergence. For a detailed discussion, see Section 2 of [M. Herbst, A. Levitt. *J. Phys.: Condens. Matter* **33** 085503 (2021) DOI: 10.1088/1361-648x/abcbdb](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-648x/abcbdb).\n",

For **bulk materials** this is feasible building on the justified approximation to ignore lattice-scale details. Mathematically one may (a) take the $q\\to0$ limit and (b) model $\\chi_0$ as a translation-independent operator. Such operators (compare to the Kinetic energy) are diagonal in Fourier space and are fully characterised by their Fourier multiplier $\\chi_0(q)$. Since $v_c$ is also translation-independent, this implies that the resulting model for the dielectric operator $P \\simeq \\varepsilon^\\dagger$ is translation-independent and its inverse can be directly computed as $P^{-1}(q) = \\frac{1}{P(q)}$ enabling an analytical computation of the inverse of the preconditioner from a dielectric model.\n",
